# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard 
## Description

For this project I created a weather dashboard what runs in the browser. 

Using the OpenWeather One Call and Current Weather Api, I was able to retrieve weather data for cities.

When a city is searched for the current and future conditions for that city is displayed. 

When the current conidtions for the city are disaplyed the city name, date, icon represneted the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index are all disaplyed. 

The UV index also has a color the indicates when the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (orange) and severe (red). 

The 5 day foreast for the searched city is displayed with teh date, icon represented the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
