# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard 
## Description

For this project I created a weather dashboard what runs in the browser. 

Using the OpenWeather One Call and Current Weather Api, I was able to retrieve weather data for cities.

When a city is searched for the current and future conditions for that city is displayed. 

When the current conditions for the city are displayed the city name, date, icon represented the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index are all displayed. 

The UV index also has a color the indicates when the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (orange) and severe (red). 

The 5 day forecast for the searched city is displayed with the date, icon represented the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

After a city is searched for it appears under the Search History and remains there after the page has been refreshed.


## Problems 

If a city is spelt incorrectly nothing loads on the page.
